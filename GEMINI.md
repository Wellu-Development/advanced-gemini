# Project Overview

This project is a tutorial for the `gemini-cli` tool. It is structured into a series of lessons, each contained in its own directory. Each lesson is a `README.md` file that explains a specific concept or feature of the `gemini-cli` tool.

The lessons cover:
-   **01_Configuracion_y_Modelos:** Basic configuration, using `/init`, and changing the AI model.
-   **02_Multiples_Agentes:** Managing multiple "agents" or "personas" for different tasks.
-   **03_Flujo_Git_IDE:** Integrating `gemini-cli` with a standard Git and IDE workflow.
-   **04_Ventajas_vs_IDE:** Understanding the complementary strengths of `gemini-cli` and IDEs.
-   **05_Manipulacion_de_Imagenes:** Using multimodal capabilities to analyze images and generate code.

# Usage

This directory is intended to be used as a hands-on tutorial. To get the most out of it, you should follow the instructions in each `README.md` file in the numbered directories.

There are no project-wide build or run commands. The exercises in each lesson are self-contained and are meant to be executed in the `gemini-cli` tool or a standard shell.
